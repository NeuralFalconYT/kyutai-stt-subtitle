### ðŸš€ Why I Made This
I used to rely on CapCut to generate subtitles, it was quick and convenient.
But when they made subtitle export a paid feature, I didnâ€™t want to depend on that anymore.

So I started putting together a solution using different open-source projects.
Today, I built another audio-to-SRT generator using Kyutai STT.
Itâ€™s not 100% perfect, but it works and thatâ€™s enough for me.
